## Python and Iteration

In working with python I always remember: a python is a duck.

What I mean is, python has a certain way of doing things. For example lets call
one of these ways listiness. Listiness works on lists, dictionaries, files, and
a general notion of something called an iterator.

But first, lets introduce the notion of a comprehension. Its a way of
constructing a list


    alist=[1,2,3,4,5]
    asquaredlist=[i*i for i in alist]
    asquaredlist




    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]



Python has some nifty functions like `enumerate` and `zip`. The first is a duck,
but the second isnt.


    enumerate(asquaredlist),zip(alist, asquaredlist)




    (<enumerate at 0x10977be10>, [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)])



Someone realized that design flaw and created izip.


    from itertools import izip
    izip(alist, asquaredlist)




    <itertools.izip at 0x1079c4e18>




    print enumerate(asquaredlist)

    <enumerate object at 0x10a040f00>



    [k for k in enumerate(asquaredlist)]




    [(0, 1), (1, 4), (2, 9), (3, 16), (4, 25)]



Open files behave like lists too!


    linelengths=[len(line) for line in open("hamlet.txt")]
    print linelengths

But perhaps we want to access Hamlet word by word and not line by line


    hamletfile=open("hamlet.txt")
    hamlettext=hamletfile.read()
    hamlettokens=hamlettext.split()
    len(hamlettokens)




    29601




    hamlettokens[1:4], hamlettokens[:4], hamlettokens[0], hamlettokens[-1]




    (['Tragedie', 'of', 'Hamlet'],
     ['The', 'Tragedie', 'of', 'Hamlet'],
     'The',
     'Denmarke.')



range and xrange get the list of integers upto N. But xrange behaves like an
iterator.


    mylist=[]
    for i in xrange(10):
        mylist.append(i)
    mylist




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]



## Dicts

These are the bread and butter. You will use them a lot. They even duck like
lists. But be careful how.


    adict={'one':1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
    print [i for i in adict], [(k,v) for k,v in adict.items()], adict.values()

    ['three', 'two', 'one'] [('three', 3), ('two', 2), ('one', 1)] [3, 2, 1]


The keys do not have to be strings. From python 2.7 you can use dictionary
comprehensions as well


    mydict ={k:v for (k,v) in zip(alist, asquaredlist)}
    mydict




    {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}



>**YOUR TURN** create a dictionary with keys the integers upto and including 10,
and values the cubes of these dictionaries


    #your code here

## Strings

Basically they behave like immutable lists


    lastword=hamlettokens[-1]
    print(lastword)

    Denmarke.



    lastword[-2]="k"

    lastword[-2]
